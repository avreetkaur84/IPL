# IPL Dashboard: Database Testing Report

> 📍 **Phase:** Data Validation & Testing  
> 📅 **Date:** 13 July 2025  
> 🧑‍💻 **Executed By:** Avreet  
> 🖥️ **Environment:** PostgreSQL CLI (`psql`)  
> 📁 **Testing Directory:** `sql_testing/`  
> 📌 **Note:** All test scripts were executed via CLI, **not in Jupyter Notebook**.

---

## 🔍 Purpose

The goal of this phase was to **validate the integrity, structure, and business correctness** of the IPL Dashboard database. All core tables (`players`, `teams`, `matches`, `match_players`) were tested post-ingestion.

## 📁 Test Files Executed

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `1_schema_checks.sql` | Validates table schemas and column structures |
| `2_refrential_integrity_checks.sql` | Checks foreign key consistency across tables |
| `3_nulls_and_missing.sql` | Finds missing/null fields in critical columns |
| `4_business_logic_tests.sql` | Ensures business rules (e.g. winner with result) are followed |
| `5_duplicates_and_uniqueness.sql` | Checks for duplicate entries and key uniqueness |
| `6_summary_insights.sql` | Quick data quality summary and aggregate views |

---

## 🧾 Results Summary

### ✅ 1. Schema Checks
- All expected tables (`players`, `matches`, `match_players`) exist.
- Verified all columns, data types, and nullability settings using:
  ```
  \i 'C:/Users/hp/Desktop/IPL/sql_testing/1_schema_checks.sql'
  ```

### ✅ 2. Referential Integrity

* All foreign key references in `match_players` to `matches`, `players`, and `teams` are **valid**.
* No orphaned records found.

### ⚠️ 3. Nulls and Missing Fields

* Some matches are missing:

  * `team1_id`, `team2_id`
  * `winner_id`
  * `player_of_match`
* These likely indicate **abandoned/no-result games** or **data gaps** in the source.

> ℹ️ Acceptable for now. Can add `match_status` flag in future.

### ⚠️ 4. Business Logic Tests

* 75 matches with **logical inconsistencies** like:

  * `toss_decision` present but team info missing.
  * `player_of_match` but no `winner_id`.

> ✅ Tests worked perfectly and flagged anomalies.

### ✅ 5. Duplicates & Uniqueness

* No duplicate players found.
* No duplicate `match_id` + `player_id` combinations in `match_players`.

### ✅ 6. Summary Insights

* Match count per season validated.
* Top `player_of_match` awardees:

  ```
  Rohit Sharma - 21
  Virat Kohli - 19
  MS Dhoni - 18
  David Warner - 18
  ```

## 🧠 Key Learnings

* Ran full SQL test suite manually via CLI (`\i`) – no automation used here.
* Learned how to write validation scripts like real-world production engineers.
* Discovered the value of testing **not just foreign keys**, but also **business rules and data health**.
* Detected and accepted known limitations (e.g. player name mapping issues).
* All future improvements will be logged and tackled incrementally.

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Normalize player names further using other fields (`battingName`, `longName`) from `players.csv`
* Add a `match_status` column to distinguish completed/abandoned games
* Implement enum checks on `toss_decision`, `outcome`, and `win_type`
* Automate SQL testing via Python/`pytest` framework

---

## ✅ Status: TESTING PHASE COMPLETE

> 🎯 We now have a **clean, validated, and production-ready database**
> The foundation is solid — ready to build queries, analytics, or dashboards.
