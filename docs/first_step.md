# IPL Insights Dashboard — Project Overview & Repo Structure

---

## 1. Project Summary

This project aims to build a comprehensive IPL (Indian Premier League) Insights Dashboard by leveraging multiple IPL datasets (CSV & JSON). The focus is to:

* Design and implement a **relational database** using PostgreSQL.
* Import and clean real IPL match, team, and player data.
* Enable efficient querying for insightful reports on matches, teams, and players.
* Lay groundwork for future phases like integrating ball-by-ball data and ML analytics.

---

## 2. Data Sources

* **Match\_Info.csv** — Overall match details (teams, date, venue, result, player of match).
* **teams\_info.csv** — Metadata about IPL teams.
* **players\_details.csv** — Player profiles with batting, bowling styles, roles, and personal info.
* *(Future)* Ball\_By\_Ball\_Match\_Data.csv for granular delivery-level data.

## 3. Database Tables & Key Attributes

| Table Name | Key Columns (examples)                                                                         | Description                        |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| matches    | match\_number, team1, team2, match\_date, toss\_winner, winner, venue, city, player\_of\_match | Stores match-level info            |
| teams      | team\_name, url, espn\_id                                                                      | Stores team metadata               |
| players    | ID, Name, battingStyles, bowlingStyles, playingRoles, dob                                      | Stores player profiles and details |

*Additional tables to be added as the project evolves.*

## 5. Workflow Summary

1. **Clone the repo** and place datasets in `/data`.
2. **Explore data** via notebooks (`/notebooks`) to understand structures and spot inconsistencies.
3. **Write and run ETL scripts** (`/src/etl.py`) to parse, clean, and load data into PostgreSQL tables.
4. **Document everything** along the way in `/docs`.
5. **Iterate** — add more data, refine DB schema, build dashboard frontend (future).
6. **Optional**: Add ML or advanced analytics in later stages.

## 6. Tips for Documentation & Efficiency

* Use **clear, concise markdown files**; make them your project bible.
* Keep notebooks focused on one goal per file — exploration, cleaning, visualization.
* Automate repetitive tasks in Python scripts to save time and avoid errors.
* Log challenges and learnings in `PROJECT_JOURNEY.md` — recruiters love this insight!
* Commit often with descriptive messages — your future self will thank you.

## Learning Goals 

| Goal                                  | How You'll Achieve It                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🗃️ **Database Modeling**             | Designing tables, FKs, and relationships from messy CSVs        |
| 🧼 **Data Cleaning & Transformation** | Convert list fields (like `team1_players`) to normalized format |
| 💻 **ETL Pipelines**                  | Write scripts to parse, clean, and insert into DB               |
| 🔍 **Complex Queries**                | Write joins, filters, aggregations                              |
| 🧱 **Backend Foundation**             | Build it like a backend system: not just analysis               |

## 🔍 1. Match Insights Module
    -Show winner, toss result, venue, city, eliminator status
    -Filter by date, team, or venue
    -Track player of the match history

## 📊 2. Team Analytics
    -List all teams
    -Show team performance across matches
    -Historical win/loss/draw record
    -Toss win vs match win correlation

## 🧑‍🎓 3. Player Profile Engine
    -List of all players with details like:
    -Batting & bowling styles
    -Roles (e.g. all-rounder, bowler)
    -DOB, image URL (for UI later)
    -Player of match frequency

## 🔗 4. Relational Complexity to Learn
    -One player → many matches
    -One match → 22 players
    -One team → many players
    -One match → toss winner → team

## Basically: 🔁 Cross-linked relational model = beautiful DB learning
