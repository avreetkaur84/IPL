# IPL Insights Dashboard

## Overview
IPL Insights Dashboard is a data-driven project that leverages detailed IPL datasets to provide meaningful insights into teams, players, and matches.  
The project focuses on building a robust PostgreSQL database backend and scalable ETL pipelines to transform raw IPL data into actionable information.

## Features
- Comprehensive relational database design to manage IPL match, team, and player data  
- ETL scripts for automated data extraction, cleaning, and loading from CSV and JSON sources  
- Exploratory data analysis with Jupyter notebooks for deep data understanding  
- Modular structure for easy extension: future phases include ball-by-ball analysis and machine learning integration  

## Data Sources
- `Match_Info.csv`: Summary of IPL matches, including results and player highlights  
- `teams_info.csv`: Metadata for IPL teams  
- `players_details.csv`: Player profiles with roles, playing styles, and demographics  
- *(Future)* Ball-by-ball match data for granular performance insights

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IPL-Insights-Dashboard.git
````

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare the database:**

   * Set up PostgreSQL locally or on a server.
   * Create necessary tables (see `docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`).

4. **Load data:**

   * Place IPL CSV files into `/data`.
   * Run ETL scripts in `/src` to populate the database.

5. **Explore data:**

   * Use Jupyter notebooks in `/notebooks` to analyze and visualize IPL stats.

## Future Work

* Incorporate ball-by-ball data for in-depth player performance analysis
* Develop a frontend dashboard for interactive visualization
* Integrate machine learning models for predictions and player performance insights
